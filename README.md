# Electricity-prices-forecasting

In this repository I would like to show you my first big project using Python. The data for the project was downloaded from public sources and it involves Poland. 

My thesis was resposible for analizing the electricity prices in hourly interval as well as making a LSTM and SARIMA-X models for future predictions of said prices. In forecasting I used not only the historical prices but also different data like different weather condiotions and factors related to production of electricity in hourly intervals as well.

For data cleaning and analizing the data I used combination of Pytohn and excel. After that, the correlation between all factors was computed. Finally, prediction models were made thanks to sklearn and statsmodel packages.
